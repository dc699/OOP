 * Config for client routing and associated options. The overall approach to routing used

 *      <li>{@link RoutingMode#MULTI_MEMBER}</li>
 *      <li>{@link RoutingMode#ALL_MEMBERS}</li>

 * <b>Special notes for {@link RoutingMode#MULTI_MEMBER} routing</b>
 * This feature requires the cluster members to be Enterprise nodes. If the cluster is not
 * licensed appropriately, the client will not be able to connect to the cluster,
 * failing with an {@link UnsupportedRoutingModeException}
 *
 * The minimum cluster version required for this feature is 5.5. If the cluster version is
 * less than 5.5, the client will not be able to connect to the cluster, failing with an
 * {@link UnsupportedClusterVersionException}
